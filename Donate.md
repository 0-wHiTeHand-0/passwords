## Important
- Donations are always considered as a "Thank you" for the project as it currently is
- This project does not have any fixed costs and does not depend on donations
- Donations go to individual people, not to the project
- This is an open source spare time project. Donations do not pay for features, they do not prioritize features and they do not get features done faster
